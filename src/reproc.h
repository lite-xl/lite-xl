Simplifies calling combinations of `reproc_wait`, `reproc_terminate` and

`reproc_wait`) until the corresponding timeout expires before continuing with
the next step.

Example:

Wait 10 seconds for the child process to exit on its own before sending
`SIGTERM` (POSIX) or `CTRL-BREAK` (Windows) and waiting five more seconds for
the child process to exit.

```c
REPROC_ERROR error = reproc_stop(process,

Call `reproc_wait`, `reproc_terminate` and `reproc_kill` directly if you need
extra logic such as logging between calls.

`stop` can contain up to three stop actions that instruct this function how the
child process should be stopped. The first element of each stop action specifies
which action should be called on the child process. The second element of each
stop actions specifies how long to wait after executing the operation indicated
by the first element.

When `stop` is 3x `REPROC_STOP_NOOP`, `reproc_destroy` will wait until the
deadline expires (or forever if there is no deadline). If the process is still
running after the deadline expires, `reproc_stop` then calls `reproc_terminate`
and waits forever for the process to exit.

Note that when a stop action specifies `REPROC_STOP_WAIT`, the function will
just wait for the specified timeout instead of performing an action to stop the
child process.

If the child process has already exited or exits during the execution of this
function, its exit status is returned.
